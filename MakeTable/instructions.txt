Approximite process.
---------------------


from the csv data from the velocity profiler (not 2):


find a divider, use the approximite maximum hitspeed and scale it back to ~256 using a 2^n divider (2, 4, 8, 16, 32...)
for example if your top speed was 30500, you could use a divider of 128 which will scale it 'close enough' 
any under-scaling will be cut off by the system anyhow.


make a new column that the post-target distance (stopPos - Hit)

chart (XY, line chart) the that stop-distance with against the HitSpeed, using HitSpeed as X

from the resulting squiggle, get some data points for the top of the trend

add those points as addPoint() functions in the code.

compile and run the program (gcc *.c  ./a.out)

it will write you a table for the C program and also dump you some SVG data to take back into the spreadsheet.

if you add an XY line chart to the same graph it should follow the top trend of the collected data.

Put the C table in the servo code, "done'. 

(this will get easier as more people use and evolve it)
